# Agile methodology

Agile methodology is a set of project management practices, especially in software development, that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and delivering value in short cycles (called sprints) rather than following a linear, inflexible plan from start to finish. It is characterized by constant adaptation to change, ongoing collaboration with the client, and a focus on people and interactions, enabling teams to respond quickly to the market and iteratively improve product quality.
