## How to research reference material

* Identify the reference document’s purpose, whether it’s a command reference, component reference, or another type. Structure and adjust the level of detail to match its purpose.  
* Analyze the application or component to determine the most critical and frequently accessed information.  
* Collaborate with engineering teams to understand technical requirements, planned features, and product roadmaps to ensure documentation evolves alongside development.  
* Participate in sprint planning, roadmap discussions, or technical reviews to align reference documentation with product milestones.  
* Interview stakeholders or gather feedback to identify common user challenges or misunderstandings.  
* Review existing documentation and competitor references to identify gaps, reuse relevant content, and ensure alignment with your documentation standards.  
* Match the level of detail to the documentation’s maturity. Focus on key use cases and provide quick updates. As the documentation matures, include detailed compatibility, edge cases and changelogs.

## How to write reference material

* Structure content to match how the product presents commands, components, or attributes, ensuring consistency with the product’s design and terminology.  
* Format content for easy scanning by using tables for parameters, compatibility, and settings; lists for options or grouped values; and object schemas or syntax blocks with examples.  
* Organize entries alphabetically when it helps users find information.  
* Present key information clearly using tables that include the name, description (what and why), whether the item is required or optional, and an example.  
* Use compatibility tables to display support across operating systems, browsers, hardware, or software versions.  
* Write in active voice with concise, accurate sentences that start with essential information, followed by helpful context or examples.  
* Avoid turning reference content into tutorials or explanations. Keep the focus factual and task-oriented.  
* Link to additional resources or articles for users seeking more detailed information.  
* Explain technical terms only when necessary and avoid unnecessary jargon that could confuse the intended audience.  
* Emphasize user needs by highlighting relevant, straightforward information and focusing on key functionalities or attributes without including irrelevant details.  
* Balance conciseness with enough detail to make the content genuinely helpful.


## How to maintain reference material

* Regularly update the reference article to reflect new features, updates, or user feedback.  
* Monitor user interactions or support tickets to identify sections that need clarification or improvement.  
* Ensure formatting and style stay consistent with documentation standards as they evolve.
